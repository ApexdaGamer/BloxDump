  A simple Python script that goes through Roblox's CDN cache and dumps any recognized files.<br>
  This essentially lets you dump assets from any Roblox game.
</p>

## Dependencies
Currently only one module is required:
```
pip install requests
```

## Support
Currently these file formats are supported:<br>
<b>Audio files (OGG)</b><br>
<b>2D Textures (PNG)</b><br>
<b>3D Textures (KTX => PNG)</b><br>

## Contributions
If there is any file format that you want to add support for, feel free to make a pull request!<br>
This is just a simple base for potentially a bigger dumping system.
